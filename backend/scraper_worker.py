"""
Standalone scraper worker — runs the APScheduler + all scraper jobs without
attaching the full FastAPI app. Intended to be deployed as a separate Railway
service sharing the API's DATABASE_URL, freeing the API process from the
event-loop starvation and DB-pool contention that comes with running heavy
scrapers in-process.

Usage:
    python -m backend.scraper_worker

Required env vars (same as the API):
    DATABASE_URL — Postgres connection string
    PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH — optional, defaults to /app/.playwright
    PORT — provided by Railway; minimal HTTP server binds it for healthchecks

A tiny FastAPI /health is served alongside the scheduler so Railway's
healthcheck (configured in railway.toml at the repo level) succeeds. The
worker does NOT serve any other routes — only /health.

On the API service, set DISABLE_SCHEDULER=1 once this worker is healthy so
the API stops also running the same jobs.
